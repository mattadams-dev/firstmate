# fm-evidence.sh - custodian write-through for expensive-to-reproduce task
# evidence.
#
# A task's surviving artifact directory, data/<task-id>/, already outlives
# cleanup on this machine. That is custody against a crash, not against a lost
# machine or a lost handoff: loose output a successor does not remember
# producing carries no provenance. This script copies that directory into a
# separate evidence repository, where real git history supplies the provenance
# and a real remote supplies off-machine durability.
#
# OPT-IN AND LOCAL. The destination is named only by the gitignored
# config/evidence-repo file in the effective firstmate home. With that file
# absent, every verb here is a silent no-op and teardown behaves exactly as it
# does today, so nothing about a repository is ever written into shared tracked
# material or into a generated brief.
#
# FIRSTMATE IS THE CUSTODIAN. Firstmate runs this at teardown. A crewmate never
# does, and no scout path ever pushes to any remote.
#
# THE LOCAL COMMIT IS THE CUSTODY GUARANTEE; THE PUSH IS BEST-EFFORT. `preserve`
# fails only when the commit fails, so its caller gates cleanup on committed
# evidence and never on a reachable network. An unreachable remote leaves the
# evidence committed locally and still reports success. Do not "tidy" that
# asymmetry into a single success path: gating cleanup on the push would make
# preserving evidence and reclaiming a worktree block each other, which is the
# deadlock this split exists to prevent.
#
# NO REDACTION, WHILE THE DESTINATION IS PRIVATE. Artifacts are copied verbatim.
# That is safe only because the destination repository is private, so the push
# verifies visibility first and REFUSES to publish into a repository that is not
# private. The check is bound to EVERY URL the push itself would reach, since a
# remote configured with several push URLs publishes to all of them at once, and
# only a github.com host - including the github.com-<alias> form a multi-account
# setup requires - can be checked at all, so no other forge can ever be
# authorized by a same-named GitHub repository. One destination that is not
# verifiably private disqualifies the whole push: offline, no gh-axi, a host
# that is not github.com, or a mirror that is public, and the push is skipped
# rather than risked while the evidence stays committed locally. The day that
# repository stops being private, pushes stop and say why.
#
# LAYOUT: <evidence-repo>/<home-tag>/<task-id>/. The home tag identifies the
# firstmate home, so concurrent tasks in different homes - two secondmates, or
# two homes that both use the task id "fix-auth" - never collide. The path is
# derivable from the task alone; `path` prints it, and there is deliberately no
# registry to consult.
#
# SIZE POLICY: an artifact at or below the direct-commit limit is committed
# whole; config/evidence-max-direct-bytes sets that limit for a home and it
# defaults to 64 MiB. Anything larger is recorded in the manifest by size and
# SHA-256 only, never by content, so a corpus that reaches tens of GB is
# described rather than committed. A symlink is recorded by its target and never
# followed, since following one would copy the very corpus it exists to avoid.
# Every artifact is listed in the manifest under one of those dispositions.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-evidence.sh preserve <task-id>   copy, commit, then best-effort push
#   fm-evidence.sh path <task-id>       print the destination path and exit
#
# Exit codes: 0 custody achieved, nothing to preserve, or disabled; 1 usage or
# configuration error; 2 the copy or commit failed, so custody was NOT achieved
# and the caller must not destroy the source.
