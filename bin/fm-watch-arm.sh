#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Safe, home-scoped (re-)arm of the firstmate watcher, with honest verification.
#
# The watcher (bin/fm-watch.sh) blocks until it has an actionable wake to
# surface, then prints one reason line and exits. While state/.afk exists the
# daemon owns triage and the watcher exits on every wake for the daemon to
# classify. Reliability depends on arming through a mechanism that SURVIVES the
# call and NOTIFIES on exit, so firstmate must run this script as the harness's
# own tracked background task (e.g. run_in_background), or - for a Claude
# primary - inside the Stop asyncRewake hook's foreground process tree
# (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), where the harness owns the process group and
# the hook's exit-2 rewake is the notification. Run it as its own standalone
# background task, never bundled onto the tail of another command.
# NEVER fire it and forget with a shell `&` inside another call: that backgrounded
# child is reaped when the call returns, leaving NO watcher running and a false
# "already running" off the dying process. That exact mistake silently took
# supervision down for ~30 minutes.
# On a harness with a PreToolUse-equivalent hook, bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh
# applies the command-position policy before the command runs; see
# docs/arm-pretool-check.md for the blessed tree and deny reason codes. It is a
# pre-execution seatbelt, not a substitute for the verification here.
#
# This script forks the watcher as a tracked child, then VERIFIES the outcome
# before it settles in. It confirms a watcher process is genuinely alive AND the
# liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) is fresh within FM_GUARD_GRACE (the
# single source of truth, shared with fm-watch.sh and fm-guard.sh), and prints
# exactly one unambiguous status line:
#   watcher: started pid=<N> (beacon fresh)              - it launched one and confirmed it
#   watcher: attached pid=<N> (beacon <age>s)            - a live+fresh successor holds the lock;
#                                                          this arm attaches and follows it
#   watcher: FAILED - no live watcher with a fresh beacon  - could not confirm one
#   watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason
#                                                        - a clean cycle ended with no wake and no
#                                                          verified healthy successor
# It NEVER reports started/attached/healthy off a stale beacon or a dead/reused pid: a
# stale-beacon or dead-pid holder either self-heals (the fresh child steals the
# dead lock per the singleton self-eviction/steal path and is confirmed) or this
# returns the FAILED line. On started it waits the child and propagates the wake
# reason; on attached it stays live across identity-matched successors. An
# attached cycle that ends without a healthy successor is a typed nonzero failure,
# never a clean empty completion. On FAILED it exits non-zero so the failure is
# loud. A live cycle already present means re-arm attaches - do not start a second
# watcher.
#
# ARMING THE SUCCESSOR IS THE FIRST ACT OF CONSUMING A WAKE, before the wake is
# handled. The watcher is one-shot by design: it exits to deliver one actionable
# reason. Nothing here used to start the next cycle, so supervision ENDED on
# every delivered wake and resumed only when some adapter above this layer
# happened to re-arm - a blind window as wide as the whole handling turn, and
# unbounded whenever that adapter path was inert (a forked Claude session whose
# Stop hook can never claim the home is the observed case). Handling first and
# arming afterwards cannot close that window; only this ordering can.
# The successor is deliberately NOT this arm's child: it must outlive this
# process, which exits as soon as it delivers the wake. Its stdout goes to a
# pid-keyed state/.watch-successor-output.<pid> file, so whichever arm later
# attaches to it can still deliver that cycle's real reason instead of reporting
# a genuine wake as an unexplained empty close.
# A successor is armed only where supervision would otherwise end: a delivered
# actionable wake, in a home that still needs supervision and is not away. Typed
# failures stay loud and unarmed so the adapter and the model still repair them.
#
# Every observed watcher cycle appends one tab-separated lifecycle record to
# state/.watch-cycle-exits.log. The arm layer owns that bounded ledger; it records
# arm/watcher identities, timestamps, exit/signal classification, beacon age,
# lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition. The separate
# state/.watch-triage.log remains exclusively the watcher's absorbed-wake debug
# log and is never written here.
#
# --restart: stop ONLY this FM_HOME's watcher (the pid recorded in THIS home's
# state/.watch.lock) and own a fresh cycle, or attach if a verified live peer
# wins the singleton while the duplicate child stands down. It
# resolves and signals exactly that pid, so it can never touch another home's
# watcher. NEVER `pkill -f
# bin/fm-watch.sh`: that pattern matches every firstmate home's watcher
# (secondmate homes run the same script) and would kill siblings.
