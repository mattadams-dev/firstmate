# Claude Stop-owned watcher auto-arm (asyncRewake hook).
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "asyncRewake": true and an explicit multi-hour timeout. Claude Code fires it
# in the background on EVERY Stop of a Claude primary session, with no
# deduplication across firings. It owns routine tokenless watcher continuity
# for Claude primaries (main home and marked secondmate homes):
#
#   - Scope: only a genuine primary checkout (plain checkout or validly marked
#     secondmate home) with AGENTS.md, bin/, and the effective state dir - the
#     exact fm-turnend-guard.sh scope. Child crew/scout worktrees stay inert.
#   - Identity: only when THIS session owns state/.lock, decided by session id
#     (bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh). When the recorded owner's pid fails the
#     shared harness-liveness predicate, the hook delegates guarded recovery to
#     bin/fm-lock.sh and then re-verifies ownership. A live owner naming another
#     session, a missing lock, a malformed lock, or an unestablishable own
#     session id all still refuse, so a competing session never arms or rewakes.
#   - Recorded refusal: an identity refusal is an OUTCOME and is written as one.
#     It records epoch outcome "refused" and, once per episode, the failure
#     notice. Exiting 0 in silence here is what made the turn-end guard's
#     bounded fail-open unreachable: the guard advances on a fresh epoch and
#     keys its escape on a verified failure, so a refusal that wrote nothing
#     starved the very backstop built to survive an unavailable auto-arm. An
#     exit that changes nothing observable is indistinguishable from an exit
#     that never ran.
#   - AFK: while state/.afk exists the away daemon owns the watcher and triage;
#     this hook exits 0 and NEVER rewakes the primary (checked again at
#     translation time so a mid-cycle AFK transition is honored).
#   - Need: arms only while work is in flight (state/*.meta) or X mode has a
#     relay poll to run (state/x-watch.check.sh); an idle home exits 0.
#   - Single-flight: Claude does not dedupe async hooks, so a home-scoped owner
#     lock (state/.claude-autoarm.lock) admits exactly one owner; every other
#     concurrent firing exits 0 without translating, which keeps one event
#     epoch on exactly one recovery turn.
#   - Foreground arm: the owner runs bin/fm-watch-arm.sh in the FOREGROUND of
#     this hook-owned process tree (never shell &); Claude owns the process
#     group, so its timeout/session teardown kills arm and watcher together.
#   - Translation: while supervision is still needed and AFK remains inactive,
#     an actionable arm close (signal:/stale:/check:/heartbeat) prints one
#     rewake banner to stderr and exits 2, which wakes Claude even while idle
#     ("Stop hook feedback"). A close that reports no actionable reason is
#     benign when a live identity-matched watcher still has a fresh beacon.
#   - Failure handling: a typed failure is rechecked against the same live,
#     fresh watcher predicate and retried a bounded number of times in this
#     hook. Only an exhausted failure with no verified watcher emits one
#     last-resort notice per failure episode; later consecutive failures still
#     exit 2 to guarantee the next Stop-owned retry without repeating notice,
#     until the synchronous guard has consumed its attended fail-open.
#
# The epoch ledger state/.claude-autoarm-epoch records the latest claim and
# outcome so the synchronous Stop guard (bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude) can
# allow a stop whose recovery this hook already owns, instead of forcing a
# duplicate continuation for the same event epoch. The failure marker
# state/.claude-autoarm-failure-notified deduplicates the last-resort notice,
# and state/.claude-autoarm-failure-alarmed bounds the attended fail-open and
# suppresses any later automatic continuation in that unresolved episode.
#
# This hook never blocks the Stop decision itself and never prints to stdout:
# exit 0 is always silent, and exit 2 carries the rewake banner on stderr.
# On any uncertainty such as unresolvable ancestry, malformed lock state, or
# lock contention, it exits 0 and leaves continuity to the synchronous guard and
# the model.
